Ignore the other assets folder. That was done by accident. The zip file will have what you need.
Instructions:
Download zip.
Unzip inital zip (thurmondwvamtrk.zip).
You will see an asset folder (dodge_the_creeps_2d_assets)along with another zip folder (Dodgethecreeps.zip), and see nothing else. If this isn't true, email me.
Ignore the other asset folder, and unzip the dodge the creeps zip.
Woo! Done!
